# Bell test in scattering halos

## Experiment
1. Entangled source
2. Local operation
3. Detection
4. Correlation

## 1. Entangled source

## 2. Local operation: Rotation
### Characterisation
Automated scanning of Raman amplitude (using AOM1 for state rotation) using code in dir_watch.

[x] load parameter log file
[x] organise data directory according to shots with same R-amp
[] analysis codebase
    [] categorise data by mf
    [] sort data by raman amplitude (easier to plot, fit, etc.)
    [] smooth halo sph density before further processing incl population, theta,...
    [] pad halo poles with NaN (at density eval)
    [] scat mode histogram of theta


## 3. Detection

## 4. Correlation
